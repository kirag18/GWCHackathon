          This place singlehandedly changed my life. Im a new woman. I never
          knew thin crust pizza could be so crunchy. I had their original cheese
          pizza and it was high quality. 10/10

        This local diner is so special. I can really tell that the employees
        care about me and they never forget my order. My only problem is that
        the food is garbage. I keep going back there for the experience of
        talking to the emmployees and buy the food to support a local business
        but when they give me the food i toss it into the trash. 5/10

        I have never actually been here before. So like i think its probably
        good but I have to try it. Other people like it so you should go there!!
        Also I passed by there once and the prices are crazy high. You need deep
        pockets to buy boba from there ?/10
