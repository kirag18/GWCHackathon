          <p>Hi, my name is Kira, and I am the founder of this organization. I started this company because I saw firsthand how many immigrants, especially those from Ukraine, were struggling to understand and manage their finances in a new country. As someone who grew up in Brooklyn, NY—the melting pot of melting pots—I was surrounded by diverse communities and witnessed the financial challenges immigrants faced. This sparked a deep passion in me to create an organization that would bridge the gap, offering the education, resources, and support necessary for immigrants to thrive financially in the U.S. </p>
