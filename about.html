          Start by listing all your monthly expenses, like rent, groceries, 
          and transportation. Compare that to your income, and see where 
          you can save—even small changes, like cooking at home more often, 
          can add up. Try saving at least 10% of what you earn each month 
          for unexpected expenses or future goals.

        Credit is a way for banks to measure trust. It shows that you 
        can borrow money and pay it back on time. Many immigrants don’t 
        have a credit history when they arrive, but there are ways to build 
        one. Getting a secured credit card, which requires a small deposit, 
        is a good start. Another option is to ask a trusted friend or family 
        member to add you as an authorized user on their credit card. Paying 
        bills like rent and electricity on time can also help because some 
        companies report payments to credit agencies.

        <h2>Taxes for Immigrants</h2>

      <p>
        Taxes are money that workers and businesses pay to the government to help 
        fund things like schools, roads, and hospitals. If you work in the U.S., 
        you usually have to pay taxes. Some people use a Social Security Number (SSN) 
        to file taxes. If you don’t have one, you might need an Individual Taxpayer 
        Identification Number (ITIN) instead. You may also get tax credits, which are 
        discounts that lower how much you owe. Be careful of scams—only use trusted 
        tax services or government websites for help.

        Managing money can be hard, but this rule helps. Half of 
        your income should go to needs like rent, food, and transportation. 
        About thirty percent can be spent on things you enjoy, like going 
        out or buying something fun. The last twenty percent should be saved 
        or used to pay off debt. If money is tight, try to save even a small 
        amount each month for emergencies.

        <h2>Sending Money to Family Back Home (Remittances)</h2>

      <p>
        Many immigrants send money to family in their home countries, 
        but sending money can be expensive. Some companies charge high 
        fees, so it’s important to compare prices before choosing a service. 
        Some banks allow you to send money for a lower cost, so it’s worth 
        checking with your bank. Be careful of scams and only send money through trusted companies.

      <p>
        Even if you are new to the U.S., you still have rights when it comes to 
        money and work. You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to open a bank account, 
        as many banks accept passports or Individual Taxpayer 
        Identification Number (ITIN)s. Employers must pay at least the minimum wage, 
        which is the lowest legal pay allowed. If you think your employer is not paying you 
        fairly, worker’s rights centers can provide free help and advice.
